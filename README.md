# Head-Bobbing-Effect-Unity-Demo-
This project demonstrates how to implement a head-bobbing effect commonly used in first-person games to increase immersion and give movement more weight. The goal was to build a simple, modular system that reacts to player motion and applies vertical camera movement without relying on external assets.

Attach SC_CharacterController to your "Player" and SC_HeadBobber to "Main Camera"
